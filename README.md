# Hello, correctors!

## Presence of print

I am aware that I left a lot of printf, but it is intentional. I could have
commented them, but I thought it would be useful for you guys!

## Poor memory management

I know, the memory management is bad.

## Maximum of rows possible

The maximum of rows I could test was 130k, I think it would
be possible if you had specific flags that would unlock the limit by default
on the compiler.

## No header in the csv file

Yeah, I have not found an efficient way.

## Code not clean

I know that my code is ugly, but it works, and I did not have the time to
refactor

Thank you,
