# Hello, correctors!

## Presence of print
I am aware that I left a lot of printf, but it is intentional, I think it 
would be easier for you to correct. I could have commented them, but I 
thought it would be useful for you guys.
## Poor memory management
I know, my memory management is bad.

## Maximum of rows possible
The maximum of rows I could test was 130k, I think it would 
be possible if you had specific flags that would unlock the limit by default 
on the compiler.

## No header in the csv file
Yeah, I have not found an efficient way.

## Code not clean
I know that my code is ugly, but it works, and I did not have the time to 
refactor


Thank you,
